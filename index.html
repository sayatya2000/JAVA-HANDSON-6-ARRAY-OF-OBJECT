    <h1>Array of object</h1>
    <h3>
        Q1. Question "let studentRecords = [ {name: 'John', id: 123, marks : 98 },
        {name: 'Baba', id: 101, marks : 23 },
        {name: 'yaga', id: 200, marks : 45 },
        {name: 'Wick', id: 115, marks : 75 } ] "
        <br>
        "We are interested in retrieving only the students' names; all the names should be in caps.
        <br>
        ['JOHN', 'BABA', 'YAGA', 'WICK']"
    </h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        let studentRecords = [
        { name: 'John', id: 123, marks: 98 },
        { name: 'Baba', id: 101, marks: 23 },
        { name: 'yaga', id: 200, marks: 45 },
        { name: 'Wick', id: 115, marks: 75 }
      ];
      
      let names = studentRecords.map((record) => record.name.toUpperCase());
      
      console.log(names); // Output: ['JOHN', 'BABA', 'YAGA', 'WICK']
      
    </pre>
    <h4>Explanation: <br>
        In this code, we use the map method on the studentRecords array to iterate over each element (i.e., each student
        record) and apply a transformation function that extracts the student name and converts it to uppercase. The
        resulting array of uppercase names is stored in the names variable and printed to the console using
        console.log().

    </h4>
    <br>
    <h3>Q2. "Suppose we have the same dataset as above but this time we want to get the details of students who scored
        more than 50 marks.

        [{name: 'John', id: 123, marks: 98 },{name: 'Wick', id: 115, marks: 75 }]"</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        const students = [
        {name: 'John', id: 123, marks: 98 },
        {name: 'Baba', id: 234, marks: 43 },
        {name: 'Yaga', id: 345, marks: 27 },
        {name: 'Wick', id: 115, marks: 75 }
      ];
      
      const passedStudents = students.filter(student => student.marks > 50);
      console.log(passedStudents);
      
    </pre>
    <h4>Explanation: <br>
        In this code, students is the original array of names, and namesInCaps is a new array that contains the same
        names but in uppercase. The map() method is applied to students using an arrow function, which iterates over
        each element in students and applies the toUpperCase() method to convert it to uppercase. The resulting array is
        then logged to the console using console.log().
    </h4>
    <br>
    <h3>Q3.Retrieve the details of students who scored more than 50 marks and have IDs greater than 120.</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        const students = [
  {name: 'John', id: 123, marks: 98 },
  {name: 'Baba', id: 234, marks: 43 },
  {name: 'Yaga', id: 345, marks: 27 },
  {name: 'Wick', id: 115, marks: 75 }
];

const filteredStudents = students
  .filter(student => student.marks > 50 && student.id > 120)
  .map(student => ({ name: student.name, id: student.id, marks: student.marks }));

console.log(filteredStudents);
//Output [
{name: 'John', id: 123, marks: 98 }
]
    </pre>
    <h4>Explanation: <br>
        In this code, the filter() method is applied to students using an arrow function, which iterates over each
        element in students and returns only those elements where the marks property is greater than 50 and the id
        property is greater than 120. The resulting array is then passed to the map() method, which creates a new array
        of objects that only contains the name, id, and marks properties of each student. The resulting array is then
        logged to the console using console.log(). The filteredStudents array will only contain the details of the
        students who scored more than 50 marks and have IDs greater than 120.
    </h4>
    <br>
    <h3>Q4.Consider the same scenario we have discussed above, but this time we would like to know the sum total of the
        marks of the students.</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        const students = [
  {name: 'John', id: 123, marks: 98 },
  {name: 'Baba', id: 234, marks: 43 },
  {name: 'Yaga', id: 345, marks: 27 },
  {name: 'Wick', id: 115, marks: 75 }
];

const totalMarks = students.reduce((acc, student) => acc + student.marks, 0);
console.log(totalMarks);
//Output - 243

    </pre>
    <h4>Explanation: <br>
        In this code, students is the original array of student details. The reduce() method is applied to students
        using an arrow function, which takes two arguments: an accumulator (acc) and the current element (student). The
        reduce() method initializes the accumulator to 0 (the second argument) and then adds the marks property of each
        student to the accumulator. The resulting sum total of marks is then logged to the console using console.log().
        The totalMarks variable will contain the sum total of the marks of all the students.
    </h4>
    <br>
    <h3>Q5.This time we want to get only the names of the students who scored more than 50 marks from the same dataset
        used above.</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        const students = [
  {name: 'John', id: 123, marks: 98 },
  {name: 'Baba', id: 234, marks: 43 },
  {name: 'Yaga', id: 345, marks: 27 },

const passedStudentsNames = students
  .filter(student => student.marks > 50)
  .map(student => student.name);

console.log(passedStudentsNames);
//Output- [  'John',  'Wick']

    <h3>Q7.This time we are required to print the total marks of the students with marks greater than 50 after a grace
        of 15 marks has been added to those students who scored less than 50.</h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        const students = [
        {name: 'John', id: 123, marks: 98 },
        {name: 'Baba', id: 234, marks: 43 },

      console.log(passedStudentsTotalMarks);
      //output- 188

    </pre>
    <h4>Explanation: <br>
        In this code, students is the original array of student details. The map() method is applied to students using
        an arrow function, which iterates over each element in students and checks if the marks property is less than
        50. If so, it returns a new object with the same properties as the original student object, but with the marks
        property increased by 15. If not, it simply returns the original student object. The resulting array of updated
        student details is stored in the updatedStudents variable. The filter() method is applied to updatedStudents
        using an arrow function, which returns only those elements where the marks property is greater than 50. The
        resulting array is then passed to the reduce() method, which creates a sum total of the marks property of each
        student. The resulting sum total of marks is then logged to the console using console.log(). The
        passedStudentsTotalMarks variable will contain the sum total of the marks of the students with marks greater
        than 50 after adding a grace of 15 marks to those students who scored less than 50.

    <h3>Q8.Create 6 objects , each object will have name, class, roll no as properties. Store these objects in an array
        of objects. </h3>
    <h4>Ans.</h4>
    <pre>
        const students = [
        { name: 'John', class: 'A', rollNo: 1 },
        { name: 'Jane', class: 'B', rollNo: 2 },
        { name: 'Bob', class: 'A', rollNo: 3 },
        { name: 'Alice', class: 'C', rollNo: 4 },
        { name: 'Mike', class: 'B', rollNo: 5 },
        { name: 'Sara', class: 'A', rollNo: 6 }

      { name: 'Sara', class: 'A', rollNo: 6 }
    ]
    
    </pre>
    <h4>Explanation: <br>
        In this code, an array of 6 objects is created with name, class, and roll no properties. Each object is
        separated by a comma, and is enclosed in curly braces. The objects are then stored in an array called students.
        Finally, the console.log() function is used to print the contents of the students array to the console.
